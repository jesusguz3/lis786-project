# More on obsessions

When you have OCD, you experience obsessions. These obsessions are constant, undesired thoughts, or images that are intrusive and cause a great amount of stress and anxiety. It's common to try to ignore these unwanted thoughts, or you might even perform a compulsive ritual or behavior to get rid of them. This only causes temporary relief, and the thoughts come back. However, many people do realize that their thoughts make no sense, but the thought still persists. Obsessions can take up a lot of a person's time.

**Other common symptoms for obsessions**
* Fear of being contaminated with body fluids, diseases, household chemicals
* Violent impulses
* Identity obsession
* Being perfect in everything you do

## More on compulsions

Compulsions are the repetitive behaviors one performs to rid themselves of the obsessive thought(s). These actions can be temporary and people with OCD usually know that, but they don't see another way to deal with the unwanted thoughts. Compulsions can take up a great deal of time, especially if the person doesn't feel satisfied the first time, they might do the behavior or ritual multiple times until they feel like they are finally satisfied and calm.

**Other common symptoms for compulsions**
* Washing in a certain way
* Checking that you did not harm someone
* Rereading or rewriting something
* Avoiding a situation where your obsessions can be activated
