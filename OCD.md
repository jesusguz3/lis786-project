# More on obsessions

When you have OCD, you experience obsessions. These obsessions are constant, undesired thoughts, or images that are intrusive and cause a great amount of stress and anxiety. It's common to try to ignore these unwanted thoughts, or you might even perform a compulsive ritual or behavior to get rid of them. This only causes temporary relief, and the thoughts come back. However, many people do realize that their thoughts make no sense, but the thought still persists. Obsessions can take up a lot of a person's time.

**Other common symptoms for obsessions:**
* Fear of being contaminated with body fluids, diseases, household chemicals
* Violent impulses
* Identity obsession
* Being perfect in everything you do

## More on compulsions

Compulsions are the repetitive behaviors one performs to rid themselves of the obsessive thought(s). These actions can be temporary and people with OCD usually know that, but they don't see another way to deal with the unwanted thoughts. Compulsions can take up a great deal of time, especially if the person doesn't feel satisfied the first time, they might do the behavior or ritual multiple times until they feel like they are finally satisfied and calm.

**Other common symptoms for compulsions:**
* Washing in a certain way
* Checking that you did not harm someone
* Rereading or rewriting something
* Avoiding a situation where your obsessions can be activated

### Treatment Options

**Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT)**

One the most common and effective ways to treat OCD is with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). The most common CBT and the one that works the best is **Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP).** This therapy is done by a licensed mental health professional. The whole point of ERP is to confront your unwanted thoughts, situations, objects, and images that make you anxious and bring about your obsessions. The goal is for you to not to act upon your compulsive behavior. All of this done under the supervision of a therapist. With time, your brain will see the object as a threat no longer. CBT can be really challenging at first, but with time and practice you will see that your thoughts are harmless, they will subside, your fears are not likely to happen, and you will be able to manage things you consider risks.

**Natural Remedies**

There are few nautral treatments for OCD. You can increase your **zinc** intake. Zinc is considered to be a neurotransmitter so it plays a role in regulating the brain's response to stress. A lack of it can cause anxiety and OCD. Foods rich in zinc are fish, beans, nuts, dairy products and whole grain cereals. So check your levels and make sure you are getting enough zinc in your diet.

Another way to help with OCD is to get **your body moving.** Walking is a great way to help reduce OCD symptoms after some time of doing it. 5 to 10 minutes a day can improve your mind. Other great physical activities include running, yoga, or riding a bike.

**Acupuncture** is also a natural way to help deal with OCD. By placing needles in specific points around the body, this releases serotonin. It lowers anxiety levels, it relaxes the mind, and returns the body to its best condition.

**Medications**

If you try CBT, and natural ways to help with your OCD and none of them work, you can also try medications. Antidepressant medications are usually used to treat OCD like Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SRI). These can help in fighting OCD symptoms.

**Common antidepressants used to treat OCD:**
* Sertraline
* Citalopram
* Clomipramine
* Paroxetine

The main job of these medications is to affect the chemical serotonin. If the brain does not have enough of this chemical, the nerves in your brain may not be communicating in the correct way. Taking medications like these can increase serotonin and get your brain where it needs to be. It is important to remember that there are side effects, so ask your doctor about the risks of taking these medications.


OCD doesn't have to control your life. You can take back the control by managing your symptoms. There are numerous things you can do to fight OCD. First you need to agknowledge that you have OCD. Next you need to know what exactly causes you to have obsessions and compulsions. Once you realize all of that, then you can start getting the help you need. You can start with Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT). You will work with a licensed professional to face your fears and the objects that cause you to have obsessive thoughts and compulsions. Or you can try natural remedies like walking, running, or riding a bike. Try getting more zinc into your diet. You can also try acupuncture. If none of these work, there are always medications you can try. Just remember to speak to your doctor to see what is the best medication for you, and make sure to discuss the potential side effects.


Remember that the thoughts associated with OCD are not real; they are just thoughts. This is important to remember when starting to treat your OCD. Remembering that they are just thoughts takes away their power, and puts you in control. OCD does not have to keep you from living a happy life. You can take charge and put your mind at ease. You can do this!
