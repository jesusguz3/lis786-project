Anxiety can also come in different forms. These are the most common:

**Agoraphobia**

People with agoraphobia fear places or situations that make them feel embarrassed, or trapped. These places
can provoke panic attacks. People with agoraphobia tend to avoid places that make them feel this way.

**Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**

People with GAD feel nonstop anxiety and worry about ordinary activites or events. The worry that is felt is bigger
than it should be.

**Panic Disorder**

People with a panic disorder get sudden bouts of severe anxiety, or terror that peak in minutes. The person may
feel shortness of breath, chest pain, and rapid heartbeat.
