**Welcome to the page all about anxiety!**
{{ page.my_variable }}



As you saw on the homepage, we already discussed a little bit what anxiety is. Here we will talk about that stuff again but go a little more in depth. Let's get started!

**Symptoms**

We discussed earlier that anxiety is something that everyone feels sometimes. It's a normal part of life. You can feel it before hacing an important meeting with your boss, changing jobs, a first date etc. But there are some people who feel this fear all the time. Sometimes they feel this when doing stressful things but the symptoms may be more severe than the average person, or sometimes a person with anxiety feel anxious for no reason. Someone with anxiety can feel **panic, danger or dread, heart palpitations, rapid breathing, or even panic attacks.** Those aren't the only symptoms. A person with an anxiety disorder can also feel **week and tired, have trouble concentrating, experience gastrointestinal problems, and avoid situations that make them feel anxious.** 

**Anxiety disorders**

We learned that there are actually multiple types of anxiety disorders. Let's look at them again, and a couple more.

**Agoraphobia**

Agoraphobia causes a person to fear going to places or being placed in a situation where they might feel like they are embarrassed, or helpless. Someone with agoraphobia may feel anxious about getting on public transportaion, going to parties, talking to someone, or being in large crowds. Someone with this type of anxiety disorder may feel like they need someone like a family member or a friend. They might try to avoid the situation or place all together. This fear of being in social settings can become so severe, that a person may feel like they can't even leave their house.

**Symptoms of agoraphobia**
* Fear of leaving home alone
* Fear of being in large crowds
* Fear of being judged in public
* Avoiding social situations

**Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**

Generalized anxiety disorder is when someone feels anxious every day for no good reason. Sometimes someone with this disorder feels anxious about everyday things. This persisting anxiety can get in the way of daily activities. They can overthink even the smallest of things.

**Symptoms of GAD**
* Constant worrying about everyday things
* Letting go of worry
* Always thinking worse-case scenarios
* Unable to relax
* Fatigue
* Irritability

**Panic Disorder**

A person with panic disorder becomes filled with fear, and it causes them to feel an intense physical reaction. A stressful situation can cause anyone to have a panic attack, but recurrent and unexpected panic attacks can mean that someone has panic disorder. Panic attacks are not life-threatening, but they can impact someone's way of life.

**Symptoms of panic attacks**
