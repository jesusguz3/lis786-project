**Welcome to the page all about anxiety!**
{{ page.my_variable }}



As you saw on the homepage, we already discussed a little bit what anxiety is. Here we will talk about that stuff again but go a little more in depth. Let's get started!

**Symptoms**

We discussed earlier that anxiety is something that everyone feels sometimes. It's a normal part of life. You can feel it before hacing an important meeting with your boss, changing jobs, a first date etc. But there are some people who feel this fear all the time. Sometimes they feel this when doing stressful things but the symptoms may be more severe than the average person, or sometimes a person with anxiety feel anxious for no reason. Someone with anxiety can feel **panic, danger or dread, heart palpitations, rapid breathing, or even panic attacks.** Those aren't the only symptoms. A person with an anxiety disorder can also feel **week and tired, have trouble concentrating, experience gastrointestinal problems, and avoid situations that make them feel anxious.** 

**Anxiety disorders**

We learned that there are actually multiple types of anxiety disorders. Let's look at them again, and a couple more.

**Agoraphobia**

Agoraphobia causes a person to fear going to places or being placed in a situation where they might feel like they are embarrassed, or helpless. Someone with agoraphobia may feel anxious about getting on public transportaion, going to parties, talking to someone, or being in large crowds. Someone with this type of anxiety disorder may feel like they need someone like a family member or a friend. They might try to avoid the situation or place all together. This fear of being in social settings can become so severe, that a person may feel like they can't even leave their house.

**Symptoms of agoraphobia**
* Fear of leaving home alone
* Fear of being in large crowds
* Fear of being judged in public
* Avoiding social situations

**Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**

Generalized anxiety disorder is when someone feels anxious every day for no good reason. Sometimes someone with this disorder feels anxious about everyday things. This persisting anxiety can get in the way of daily activities. They can overthink even the smallest of things.

**Symptoms of GAD**
* Constant worrying about everyday things
* Letting go of worry
* Always thinking worse-case scenarios
* Unable to relax
* Fatigue
* Irritability

**Panic Disorder**

A person with panic disorder becomes filled with fear, and it causes them to feel an intense physical reaction. A stressful situation can cause anyone to have a panic attack, but recurrent and unexpected panic attacks can mean that someone has panic disorder. Panic attacks are not life-threatening, but they can impact someone's way of life.

**Symptoms of panic attacks**
* Trembling
* Rapid Heart Beat
* Chest Pain
* Sweating
* Shortness of breath

**Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**

On this website we have a section dedicated to OCD, but we'll give you brief description. A person with OCD has undesired thoughts (obsessions) which leads to repetitive actions (compulsions). These can get in the way of everyday activites and take up a lot of time. Check out our OCD page for more information!

* Doubting
* Unwanted thoughts

**Just a few symptoms of compulsions**

**Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)**

It's totally normal to feel anxious sometimes in social settings. Maybe you're going on a first date, meeting an executive at your job, or giving a presentation in front of a lot of people. But if you have social phobia, normal social interactions cause great amounts of anxiety because you fear being judged or embarassed by the people around you. This phobia can inhibit your function at your job, school, in your relationships, and daily activities. This fear can lead to avoidance of everyday things.

**Symptoms**
* Fear of interacting with people you don't know
* Worry about embarassing yourself
* Avoiding doing certain things like speaking to people out of fear of being embarassed
* Trembling
* Sweating 
* Heart palpitations

# Treatments 

You can't get rid of anxiety completely, after all anxiety can be good since it can make us aware of danger, keeps us prepared, and we can guess when something is risky. But for someone with an anxiety disorder, they may want to keep their symptoms under control and keep them from getting in the way of their life. There are treatment options both natural and medical. First we will talk about natural remedies one can take, and if those don't suffice we will have medical treatment options as well.

**Natural Remedies**

 **Physical Activity**

Make sure you keep an active lifestyle. While regular physical activty can keep you in good physical shape, it can also work wonder for your mental shape as well. Getting your body up and moving can keep your mind off things that can cause you anxiety. Getting your heart rate to go up can have an impact on your brain chemistry, and release anti-anxiety neurochemicals like endorphins, and serotonin. Some forms of physical activity you can do to boost these chemicals are walking, running, swimming, riding a bike and hiking. Yoga can also help boost these chemcials.

 **Get a good night's sleep**

Msking sure you are getting a good night's sleep is a great natural way to help with your anxiety. It's recommended that one gets 7 to 9 hours of sleep every day. Here are some tips to make sure you can a good night's rest. Only sleep at night when you are tired, and try to avoid taking naps during the day. Try not to watch TV, or go on your phone right before bed. Don't drink cofee or have a big meal right before bed. Maintain a cool room. And try to go to sleep at the same time every day.

 **Have a healthy diet**

 Try to avoid unhealthy foods as much as you can. Foods that have artifical flavors and colors, and preservatives can affect the brain in people and can lead to an increase in anxiety. A diet high in sugar can also alter someone's mind. Dehydration can also play a role in anxiety. Make sure you are drinking plenty of water to stay hydrated. Eat less processed foods and eat more foods rich in complex carbohydrates. Foods like oats, brown rice and barley are just a few of the foods that are made up of complex carbs. Also make sure to eat more fruits like blueberries, oranges, avocados, and bananas. Also vegetables like spinach, beets, broccoli and kale. Fish can help and lean ptoteins.

 **Practice on calming your breathing**

 When someone is having an anxiety attakcs or is simply feeling anxious, it is common for the person to start breathing rapidly. This rapid breathing can lead to heart palpitations, dizziness, and it can lead to a panic attack. Practicing and mastering the art of deep breathing can help a tremendous amount in restoring normal breathing and to reduce the anxiety being felt.
